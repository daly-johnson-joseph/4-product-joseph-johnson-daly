      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 2019</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Kylie, Hayilice, and Samantha started off in the small state of Massachusetts. Their goal was to bring the special taste of the food held in their restaurant comes from all the different places located around the world all the way from France to Thailand. It all started when they went on vacation to Honolulu, Hawaii. All they wanted was food from home and came to the realization that everyone wants a piece of wherever they went. The food we carry in Johnson, Joseph Daly Dishes consists of homemade recipes from generations before us. We recognized that having a piece of home travel with you is a very important part of a vacation so every item on our menu costs less than twenty dollars which goes toward funding special causes such as saving the marine life and coral reefs</p>
